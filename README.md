Up and Running with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---
The Mac version (Windows tutorial coming soon)

> I used OSX Version 10.11.3 (El Capitan) while creating this tutorial

If you are new to Jekyll, Git or GitHub don't stress, I will be walking you through everything you need to know to get started. You can do this tutorial even if you've *never* built a website.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static website generator (only files, no databases) that we will use to create our website/blog.

Think of [Git](https://git-scm.com) as a way to version control your files, and [GitHub](https://github.com) as a social networking site (like Facebook) where we upload our files for sharing and collaborating. And it just so happens that we will also be using GitHub as our hosting service for FREE.
